                    I am the Public Relations and Communications representative, and part of my duties includes creating designs. The Winter Solstice greeting cards are a component of external communication and public relations.
                    <br>The purpose of the card is to send our gratitude for the collaboration and the support they have provided us through the year on this day traditionally celebrated by the Indigenous Peoples.
                    <br>Each of the 3 locations at VACFSS also receives a different volume of cards which needs coordinating.
                    <br>I am also part of that planning process with support from my supervisor.
                    <br>The printed greeting cards will be sent out to our 250+ community partners and ~250 caregivers.                </p>

                    Since the beginning of my position in May 2020, I have developed a habit of collecting artworks I love, created by Indigenous artists in the Lower Mainland.
                    <br>I display these works alongside digital archives to inspire the graphic designs and illustrations I create for VACFSS.                </p>

                    I find jotting down ideas to be the best practice, so for the first few weeks,
                    <br>I educated myself on Indigenous mythology, cultural terms, and symbolism of various nations of the Coast Salish and Vancouver area.                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the challenges I faced was how the painting on an iPad lacked scalability and the ability to adjust colors.
                    <br>Whereas on Illustrator, I could sketch out concepts with vectors, and the lines would never be blurry.
                    <br>Coast Salish works and formline design are also composed of clean and smooth outlines and symbols, which I felt my drawings lacked.
                    <br>So despite having worked on painting and sketching on Procreate for many days, I went on to vectorize my design on Illustrator.

                <p>I received critique from my supervisor at the time that the raven was a little distracting and not "friendly enough," so I had to remove it in the next stage of my process.

                    <p>However, having purchased books on Indigenous stories and learned so much, I felt the need to include them in my piece.

                        <br>each figure would represent a spirit, such as the thunderbird, the men in the woods, the eagle, and the raven dancing around the fire.

                    <br>I also "mastered" the use of gradients, a tool that I was previously intimidated by.
