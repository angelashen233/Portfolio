                <p>I find drawing down ideas to the best practice, so for the first few weeks,
                    <br> I educated myself on Indigenous methology, cutlural terms, and symbolism of various nations of the Coast Salish and Vancouver area.

            <div class="medium-8 cell">
                <p>One of the challenges I faced was how the painting on an ipad lacked scalability and the ability to adjest colors. 
                    <br>Where as on Illustrator I could sketch out concepts with vector and the lines would never be blurry. 
                    <br>-Coast Salish works, and formline design also conposed on clean and smooth outlines, and symobles which I felt my drawings lacked. 
                    <br>So dispite having worked on paintng and sketching on Procreate for many days, I went on to vectorize my design on illustrator.

                        <br> Instead of people that are the same only with different colors like in the inital painting.
                        <br> Each figure would be a spirit of such as the thunderbird, the men in the woods,the Eagle,and the raven dancing around the fire. </p>

                        <br>I have faced with a learning curve bouncing from ideas until the last week of the deadline.
                        <br>I also "mastered" the use of gradient, a tool that I was previously intimiated by.
