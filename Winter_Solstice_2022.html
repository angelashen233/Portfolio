                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>Starting 2018 VACFSS has moved away from designing Christmas themed celebratory cards to the recognition of Winter Solstice.  
                </p>
                <h4>Challenge</h4>
                <p> 
                    As a non-Indigenous designer tasked to create the design, I conducted research and gained approval for purchasing 3 books on learning Indigenous Coast Salish art and culture.
                </p>
                <h4>My role</h4>
                <p>I created illustration and visual design of both Winter Solstices appreciation cards design and the organization of the mailing and ordering for the number of cards for the agency. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <img class="img" src="/img/WS_2022/Books_refrence.png" alt="3 books I used to learn about Formline design, and Coast Salish Indigenous arts.">
            </div>
        </section>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <h4>Sketching</h4>
        <p>With books on different symbolic meaning, I explores the sun, the moon, and different compositions.  

            There were the Raven, the Eagle, the man in the woods, and the Thunderbird.  
            
            The start constellation visible, with different name across culture, it's as the 7 sisters here at Coast
        </p>

        <h4>Intial Idealization</h4>

        </div>
        <h4>Indigenous Mythology</h4>
        <p>I chose to include the Thunderbird, the men in the woods,the Engel,and the raven.</p>

        <h4>Final Design</h4>

        </div>
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <p>I organized the order of 350 cards of our 3 locations, and coordinated mailout of 150 of the cards to our community partners. </p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>I was able to visualize many mythologies I have learned through reading, and gaining the approval of the Indigenous Cultural elders for this design before coordinating the printing and mailout of the greeting cards in time of the Winter Solstice.</p>
