        <h2>Winter Solstice 2022</h2>
        <a href="Winter_Solstice_2023.html">2023 version</a>
        <h4>Context</h4>
        <p>The Winter solstice is significant in Indigenous communities because it marks the start of the new season, and is celebrated with rituals and ceremonies. It is seen as a time of renewal and rebirth, and is a reminder of the importance of connection to the land.</p>
        <p>To ensure I understand and created an educated illustation respectful to the Indigneous culture, I reqested the purchese of 3 books. The first being the general understanding of the art form in different dimensions, the second on how to design more Pacific Northwest Coast region artwork.
        With the third a collection of assts, and guide to recognizing the different crest of the Northwest Coast region.</p>
        
        <h4>My role</h4>
        <p>I created illustration and visual design of both Winter Solstices appreciation cards design and the organization of the mailing and ordering for the number of cards for the agency. </p>
        <h4>Intial Idealization</h4>
