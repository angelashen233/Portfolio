                <p>
                This video hopes to showcase the day in the life of a social worker in the childsafety department. 
                <br>With the goals to not only showcase how the department is structure, how restortive practice working with Indigenous children is implemented, 
                <br>but also an inner look of how working for a non-profit childwelfare agency is like.
                <br>I also initiated an interview with Jackie so the viewers can have a better understanding of the history of the social worker, Jackie, in the video. 
                <br>You can visit the blog published on the VACFSS website <a href="https://www.vacfss.com/restorative-practice/staff-spotlight-jackie-child-safety-social-worker/"> here.</a>

                <p>As the PR and Communciations Assistant, I worked with the Associate to film, edit, and coordinate the approval process when my supervisor left the agency.</p>

            <div class="medium-8 cell">
                <p>The inital verison was over 10mins, and after weeks of editing, I was finally able to cut the video down to 6 mins. 
                    There was also use of the wording caseload, which was replaced by later recording of the voice over to use families, as social workers work with people and is a more appropiate term in this case.

                    It was my first time working with a camera and a gimbal, so the shoots did not turn as the best. 
                    <br>There were also recording of audio as the wording had to be changes in certain parts. 
                    <br>Luckly, it was in a scene where Jackie was looking away from the camera.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>

            <div class="medium-8 cell">
                <p>
                    <p>As an adminstrative worker, and non-Indigenous person, I needed to be careful in filming, 
                    <br>and later editing to inlude/protray the day inthe life of a social worker as honestly and factually as possible. 
                    <br>Hence the video was completed in 2023, but took another 3 months of approval from the directors, 
                    <br>and CEO to be released on the offical website and Youtube Channel.
                    <br>Even my reflection which I published on Linkedin took me days to rewrite,with emphsis that the video cannot represent every social workers's experience. 
                    <br>As of right now the video has gained 170 views, which is not a lot but considering how the videos created by a professional team only gathered the same amount of views, 
                    <br>and had led our website 700+ traffic visits, I would consider this a minor success.
