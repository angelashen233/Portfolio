        <h4>Context</h4>
        <p>The last video covering VACFSS adminstration was 2 years ago. This video hopes to showcase the day in the life of a social worker in the childsafety department. With the goals to not only showcase how the department is structure, how restortive practice working with Indigenous children is implemented, but also a inner look of how working for a non-profit childwelfare agency is like.</p>
        
        <h4>My role</h4>
        <p>As the PR and Communciations Assistant, I worked with the Associate to film, edit, and coordinate the approval process when my supervisor left the agency.</p>
        
        <h4>Intial version</h4>
        <p>The inital verison was over 10mins, and after weeks of editing, I was finally able to cut the video down to 6 mins. 
            There was also use of the wording caseload, which was replaced by later recording of the voice over to use families, as social workers work with people and is a more appropiate term in this case.
        </p>
        <h4>Challenge</h4>
        <p>As an adminstrative worker, and non-Indigenous person, I needed to be careful in filming, and later editing to inlude/protray the day inthe life of a social worker as honestly and factually as possible. Hence the video was completed in 2023, but took another 3 months of approval from the directors, and CEO to be released on the offical website and Youtube Channel.</p>

        <h4>Final Design</h4>

        </div>
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <p>Due to the dely for approval, I initiated an interview with Jackie, and planned the social meida release as part of the social worker week.</p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>As of recenty, the video has gather over 140 view, supported our VACFSS traffic by 100%</p>
