                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>Starting 2018 VACFSS has moved away from designing Christmas themed celebratory cards to the recognition of Winter Solstice.
                    <br>The communications department creates and coordinates the design and the greeting cards to be delievered to the community partners.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>This is the second illustration I've created for VACFSS. and it's a landscape piece made with Illustrator. After making a piece that focused on methodology, 
                    <br> I wanted to explore celebrating Indigenous dances and peoples.
                    <br> Moving away from just using gradients, I began incorporating texture by masking the clothes to emphasize the atmosphere of the night and the fire. I'm proud to have been able to reference photos I personally took at the 2023 Caregiver Appreciation Event.

                <h4>Social Media</h4>
                <p>I created a new formate and design for the materials released to the public, this year the content was not only shared to instgram but also to LinkedIn.
                    A picture of our elder April was also included in giving credit.
