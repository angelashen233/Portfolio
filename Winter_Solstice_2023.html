                I am the Public Relations and Communications representative, and part of my duties includes creating designs. The Winter Solstice greeting cards are a component of external communication and public relations.
                <br>The design is created by me, reviewed by the supervisor (the postion was vacant at the time), approved by the directors, and finally submitted to the CEO for approval before printing.

                    As the second illustration I created for the Winter Solstice at VACFSS, I am proud to have coordinated the orders, design, and concept without supervision.
                    <br>I felt challenged by my previous design, so this year I attempted to utilize event photos I have personally taken.
                    <br>Which I felt had succeeded, as one of the social workers reached out to me and asked if one of the children was someone previously in care.
                    <br>The dancer was recognized by family members, and they wondered if I could send over more cards to share amongst them.
                    <br>That exchange was one of the most fulfilling moments for me in this project as I had no support besides my own will to create a design better and more representative of the beauty of Indigenous Peoples and their arts.
                    <br>Technique-wise, I have improved my skill with illustrating people in detail along with the use of masking with textures to help further enhance the depth of my illustration.
                    <br>The masking technique also helped emphasize the atmosphere of the night and the fire.
