        <h4>Context</h4>
        <p>I also prepared internal and external materials to share the poem digitally.As not all our partners have accurate mailling locations.</p>
        <h4>Impact</h4>
        <p>I organized the order of 350 cards of our 3 locations, and coordinated mailout of 150 of the cards to our community partners. </p>
        <h4>Social Media</h4>
        <p>I created a new formate and design for the materials released to the public, this year the content was not only shared to instgram but also to LinkedIn.
            A picture of our elder April was also included in giving credit.

        <h4>Challenge</h4>
        <p>As a non-Indigenous designer, I need to take the extra time to study and understand every element of my design. Having created a design on Indigenous methology what can I create this year that relates to last year's design while being creative became the main challenge. 
        Since my supervisor's leave, I am incharge of the design, and poem of choice. </p> 
        <p>
            The coordination was especially difficult as different locations, directors, and exectvie assistant had their own list of contacts.
