        <h2>Caregiver Recruitment Campaign</h2>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Caregivers provides temporary care for Indigenous children in need of support while their family is still adjusting or recovering to reunification. The recruitment team inquired me to increase awareness on our recruitment of the caregiver across Greater Vancouver through digital advertisement campaign.  
        </p>
        <h4>Method</h4>
        <p> VACFSS has over 5.3k followers on Facebook, so Facebook AD management was used, a set of A and B ad set was used for initial comparison.   
        </p>

        <h4>Budget</h4>
        <p> $1500 across Feb 28th (Friday) to April.   
        </p>

        <h4>My responsibilities:  </h4>
        <p>
            Coordinated and managed meeting to finalize details on the Campaigns.  
            Conducted monitored Ad  Campaigns activity  
            Drafted, finalized, published ad campaigns, and reported results with stakeholders.          
        </p>

        <li>
            There was limited time-frame to release the ad, despite designing previously with the slogan alongside the image, I realized it was best to create the ad with the manager so the slogan doesn't repeat alongside the Facebook link + caption and can be adjusted easily with FB auto recommendations across Instagram, stories, and posts.  
        </li>
        <li>
            We used stock images previously used on the VACFSS website to ensure that it would not need more time for approval. Amongst the photos it needs to be inclusive of children of various ages.   
        </li>
        <li>There wasn't time to create a video, so by the end of the month Facebook reported creative tiredness, since viewers might have already seen the ad. </li>
        
        
        <div class="grid_2">
            <img class="img" src="img/Meta_suit_screenshoot.png"width="50%" alt="image of the VACFSS meta profile">
        </div>

        <h4>Next steps</h4>
        <p>
            I initialized to create a video with the recruitment team leader a short video inviting people to sign up for the Information session. It is currently in the working.   
        </p>
        <h4>Result</h4>
        <p> 
            The first month was a tremendous success, with increased registration from 1 per month to 43 within March, increasing page visitation by 8.8k%, making the caregiver page the #1 visited site of the agency. With about 50% of the budget spent, and average cost of $0.36 per landing page view.
