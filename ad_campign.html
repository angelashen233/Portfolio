            <p> VACFSS has over 5.3k followers on Facebook, so Facebook AD management was used, a set of A and B ad set was used for initial comparison.

                Coordinated and managed meeting to finalize details on the Campaigns.  
                Conducted monitored Ad  Campaigns activity  
                Drafted, finalized, published ad campaigns, and reported results with stakeholders.          
            </p>
    
            <li>
                There was limited time-frame to release the ad, despite designing previously with the slogan alongside the image, I realized it was best to create the ad with the manager so the slogan doesn't repeat alongside the Facebook link + caption and can be adjusted easily with FB auto recommendations across Instagram, stories, and posts.  
            </li>
            <li>
                We used stock images previously used on the VACFSS website to ensure that it would not need more time for approval. Amongst the photos it needs to be inclusive of children of various ages.   
            </li>
            <li>There wasn't time to create a video, so by the end of the month Facebook reported creative tiredness, since viewers might have already seen the ad. </li>

            <p>
                I initialized to create a video with the recruitment team leader a short video inviting people to sign up for the Information session. It is currently in the working.   
            </p>
            <h4>Result</h4>
            <p> 
                The first month was a tremendous success, with increased registration from 1 per month to 43 within March, increasing page visitation by 8.8k%, making the caregiver page the #1 visited site of the agency. 
                With average cost of $0.36 per landing page view, I learned about how I am able to launch a ad campaign by myself, and what I can do in the future to better imporve, like location targeting, and video content.
